There are a number of deep learning libraries available:  Here’s a list of some of the most popular deep learning libraries, and the organizations who developed and support them.

## Popular High-Level Deep Learning Libraries

`@script`
There are also some popular “high-level” deep learning libraries, which are built on top of, or “wrapped around” a deep learning library to make it easier to use.  It helps newcomers get to the  deep learning faster.

Keras is one of those “high level” libraries, and it runs on top of a number of DL libraries such as TensorFlow, Theano, Cognitive Toolkit and MxNet.  

Fastai is a DL library that used to run on top of Keras.

But, then PyTorch was released, and it was much easier to use, given that it was written in Python, and now Fastai is built on top of PyTorch. 

In this course, we will focus on PyTorch.
